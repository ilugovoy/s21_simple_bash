This is a sample text file for testing the functionality of the program.
It contains different lines, tabs, and line breaks.
Let's see how the program handles various options:

-b or --number-nonblank: This option adds line numbers only to non-blank lines.
1. This line has a number.
2. This line also has a number.
3.
4. This line is the fourth one.
5.


                                        This line contains a tab before the text.                       



    
-e: This option indicates that an additional character should be displayed at the end of each line, such as a dollar sign ($).
This line has an additional character at the end.$
This line also ends with an additional character.$
This line is empty.$

-n or --number: This option adds line numbers to all lines, including blank lines.
1. This line has a number.
2. This line also has a number.
3.
4. This line is the fourth one.
5.

-s or --squeeze-blank: This option removes multiple consecutive blank lines and replaces them with a single blank line.

- t: This option indicates that tabs should be expanded. Here is a tab:	And here is the expanded tab.

That's it for the sample text file. You can use it to test the program's functionality and see how the different options work. Happy testing!
